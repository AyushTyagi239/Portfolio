  intro:
    "Generative AI: Driving the Next Wave of Innovation\n\n" +
    "Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how organisations create and operate. Unlike traditional AI that follows fixed rules, GenAI learns from large datasets and generates new content—text, images, designs, and simulations—enabling faster decisions and smarter product development.\n\n" +
    "As industries embrace automation and digitalisation GenAI accelerates product design, enhances defect detection, and optimises production processes. It boosts innovation while improving quality and reducing delays.\n\n" +
    "GenAI vs Conventional AI\n" +
    "Traditional AI automates predefined tasks, whereas GenAI understands patterns, creates new outputs, and supports creative and strategic workflows across design, engineering, and manufacturing.",
