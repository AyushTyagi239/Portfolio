    intro:
    "Cybersecurity is now a critical priority as digital systems become central to daily life and business operations. With cyberattacks projected to cause trillions in global damage, and a significant shortage of skilled professionals—especially in India—the need for advanced security education has never been greater. This program introduces learners to modern security concepts, with a focus on Confidential Computing, an emerging approach that protects data not only at rest or in transit but also while it is actively being used.\n\n" +

    "Students gain foundational knowledge in computer architecture, cryptography, virtualization, and cutting-edge technologies like Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) and Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX). Designed with input from IIT Kharagpur professors and Intel experts, the course provides hands-on experience with secure enclaves, trusted execution environments, and hardware-based protection. This prepares learners to understand and apply modern cybersecurity techniques that safeguard sensitive data in today’s complex digital landscape.",
